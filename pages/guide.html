    <h2> In The Store - By Origin </h2>

        This is for the pros, who really want to get into coffee.<br />
        The origin of your coffee beans can be the difference between loving and hating a cup of coffee. <br />
        Often times, coffee beans are often blends from multiple origins to gain a more complex flavour. However, understanding the differences between single origin beans will give you a better understanding of coffee flavours.

<div class="origin">
     <ul>
    <li>
      <u> <b> African and Arabian beans </b> </u> <br />
      These beans tends to provide the most intense, slightly acidic and complex flavour, and tend to have fruiter and wine-like notes like blackcurrant.  They are best served as an espresso. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
      <u> <b> Central and South American beans </b> </u> <br />
      These beans tend to provide a much more balanced, milder and sweet flavour, which often have notes of chocolate and tend to suit the addition of milk. <br />
    </li>

  <li>
    <u> <b> Asia-Pacific beans </b> </u> <br />
    These beans tend to provide a moderate intensity and acidity with a rich flavour but are earthier and have a "dry" aftertaste. They are best suited for black coffees, occasionally with milk. <br />
  </li>
